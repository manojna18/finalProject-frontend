## Introduction

**Plant Plate** is a platform where vegans and vegetarians can explore a wide range of recipes, track their nutrition intake, and save their favorite recipes and meal plans. Our app aims to simplify the plant-based lifestyle, making it easier and more enjoyable. We decided to create this project because there are three vegans/vegetarians in our group, and we know how tricky it is to find good vegan recipes and how important it is to keep track of your macros on a plant-based diet.

- **Recipe Lookup**: Find vegan and vegetarian recipes easily.
- **Nutrition Tracking**: Keep track of your daily nutrition intake.
- **Favorites & Meal Plans**: Save your favorite recipes and organize them into meal plans.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and management with Firebase.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **API**: Spoonacular API for recipe data
